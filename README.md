OVERVIEW OF ONLINE BAKING SYSTEM

Introduction:
An Online Banking System in Java is a console-based application that provides essential banking functionalities for users. It is designed to mimic real-world banking operations like account management, transactions, and user information updates. This project demonstrates core programming concepts, including object-oriented principles, data management, and secure transaction handling.

Project Scope
The system aims to:

Enable users to create and manage bank accounts.
Allow secure deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers.
Maintain transaction history for each account.
Facilitate updates to personal information.
Operate through an intuitive, menu-driven interface.


Features

Account Management: Create accounts with unique identifiers.
                    Store user details such as name and account ID.
                    
Transactions: Deposit and withdraw funds securely.
              Transfer money between accounts.
              Prevent invalid operations like overdrafts.
              
Transaction History: Maintain a detailed log of all transactions for each account.

Personal Information Management: Update account holder names and details as needed.

User Interaction: Menu-driven options for seamless navigation.
                  Input validation to handle errors gracefully.

                  
System Design

Object-Oriented Approach: Classes like BankAccount represent individual accounts, encapsulating data and methods.
                          A BankingSystem class manages accounts collectively.
Data Structures: Use of HashMap or similar collections to store and manage accounts efficiently.

Transaction Management: Track deposits, withdrawals, and transfers through a list of transaction records.

Error Handling: Validate inputs to prevent invalid transactions (e.g., negative amounts or non-existent accounts).

Scalability: Designed for easy integration with advanced features like authentication or database storage.


Algorithm

Initialize System: Display menu options for operations like account creation, transactions, and updates.

User Input: Accept user choices and required details like account ID and transaction amount.

Account Operations: Handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers securely.

Transaction History: Log each transaction for future reference.

Manage Personal Information: Allow users to update account holder details.

Repeat or Exit: Loop back to the menu unless the user chooses to exit.


Advantages

Real-World Simulation: Mimics real banking operations for practical learning.

Object-Oriented Design: Promotes clean, modular, and reusable code.

Scalability: Can be extended with features like multi-user support, authentication, or GUI.

Educational Value: Demonstrates key Java concepts like classes, data encapsulation, and collections.


Project Workflow

Start: Initialize the system and display a menu.

User Interaction: Prompt users to choose an operation.

Processing: Perform operations like account creation or transactions.

Output: Display results or error messages as needed.

Repeat: Return to the menu unless the user opts to exit.

End: Close the system and thank the user.
